## Statics

TypeScript has static members. To access the static members of a class, you can use the class name followed by a dot, without the need to create an object.

```typescript
class OfficeWorker {
    static memberCount: number = 0;

    constructor(private name: string) {
        OfficeWorker.memberCount++;
    }
}

const w1 = new OfficeWorker('James');
const w2 = new OfficeWorker('Simon');
const total = OfficeWorker.memberCount;
console.log(total); // 2
```
