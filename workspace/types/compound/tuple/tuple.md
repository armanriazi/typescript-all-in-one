## Tuple Type
JavaScript doesn't have first class tuple support. People generally just use an array as a tuple. This is exactly what the TypeScript type system supports. Tuples can be annotated using `: [typeofmember1, typeofmember2]` etc. A tuple can have any number of members. Tuples are demonstrated in the below example:

```ts
var nameNumber: [string, number];

// Okay
nameNumber = ['Jenny', 8675309];

// Error!
nameNumber = ['Jenny', '867-5309'];
```

Combine this with the destructuring support in TypeScript, tuples feel fairly first class despite being arrays underneath:

```ts
var nameNumber: [string, number];
nameNumber = ['Jenny', 8675309];

var [name, num] = nameNumber;
```


### Variadic Tuple Types

Variadic Tuple Types are a features introduces in TypeScript version 4.0, letâ€™s start to learn them by revise what is a tuple:

A tuple type is an array which has a defined length, and were the type of each element is known:

```typescript
type Student = [string, number];
const [name, age]: Student = ['Simone', 20];
```

The term **"variadic" means indefinite arity** (accept a variable number of arguments).

A variadic tuple is a tuple type which has all the property as before but the exact shape is not defined yet:

```typescript
type Bar<T extends unknown[]> = [boolean, ...T, number];

type A = Bar<[boolean]>; // [boolean, boolean, number]
type B = Bar<['a', 'b']>; // [boolean, 'a', 'b', number]
type C = Bar<[]>; // [boolean, number]
```

In the previous code we can see that the tuple shape is defined by the `T` generic passed in.

Variadic tuples can accept multiple generics make them very flexible:

```typescript
type Bar<T extends unknown[], G extends unknown[]> = [...T, boolean, ...G];

type A = Bar<[number], [string]>; // [number, boolean, string]
type B = Bar<['a', 'b'], [boolean]>; // ["a", "b", boolean, boolean]
```

With the new variadic tuples we can use:

- [x] The spreads in tuple type syntax can now be generic, so we can represent higher-order operation on tuples and arrays even when we do not know the actual types we are operating over.
- [x] The rest elements can occur anywhere in a tuple.

Example:

```typescript
type Items = readonly unknown[];

function concat<T extends Items, U extends Items>(
    arr1: T,
    arr2: U
): [...T, ...U] {
    return [...arr1, ...arr2];
}

concat([1, 2, 3], ['4', '5', '6']); // [1, 2, 3, "4", "5", "6"]
```
