It is not possible to check TypeScript types at runtime. For example:

<!-- skip -->
```typescript
interface Animal {
    name: string;
}
interface Dog extends Animal {
    bark: () => void;
}
interface Cat extends Animal {
    meow: () => void;
}
const makeNoise = (animal: Animal) => {
    if (animal instanceof Dog) {
        // 'Dog' only refers to a type, but is being used as a value here.
        // ...
    }
};
```

As the types are erased after compilation, there is no way to run this code in JavaScript. To recognize types at runtime, we need to use another mechanism. TypeScript provides several options, with a common one being "tagged union". For example:

```typescript
interface Dog {
    kind: 'dog'; // Tagged union
    bark: () => void;
}
interface Cat {
    kind: 'cat'; // Tagged union
    meow: () => void;
}
type Animal = Dog | Cat;

const makeNoise = (animal: Animal) => {
    if (animal.kind === 'dog') {
        animal.bark();
    } else {
        animal.meow();
    }
};

const dog: Dog = {
    kind: 'dog',
    bark: () => console.log('bark'),
};
makeNoise(dog);
```
