TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, so the "class" keyword can be used as a type and value at runtime.

```typescript
class Animal {
    constructor(public name: string) {}
}
class Dog extends Animal {
    constructor(
        public name: string,
        public bark: () => void
    ) {
        super(name);
    }
}
class Cat extends Animal {
    constructor(
        public name: string,
        public meow: () => void
    ) {
        super(name);
    }
}
type Mammal = Dog | Cat;

const makeNoise = (mammal: Mammal) => {
    if (mammal instanceof Dog) {
        mammal.bark();
    } else {
        mammal.meow();
    }
};

const dog = new Dog('Fido', () => console.log('bark'));
makeNoise(dog);
```

In JavaScript, a "class" has a "prototype" property, and the "instanceof" operator can be used to test if the prototype property of a constructor appears anywhere in the prototype chain of an object.

TypeScript has no effect on runtime performance, as all types will be erased. However, TypeScript does introduce some build time overhead.



## Future JavaScript => Now
TypeScript provides a number of features that are planned in ES6 for current JavaScript engines (that only support ES5 etc). The TypeScript team is actively adding these features and this list is only going to get bigger over time and we will cover this in its own section. But just as a specimen here is an example of a class:

```ts
class Point {
    constructor(public x: number, public y: number) {
    }
    add(point: Point) {
        return new Point(this.x + point.x, this.y + point.y);
    }
}

var p1 = new Point(0, 10);
var p2 = new Point(10, 20);
var p3 = p1.add(p2); // { x: 10, y: 30 }
```

and the lovely fat arrow function:

```ts
var inc = x => x+1;
```

Enums are comparable and valid with numbers and vice versa, but comparing Enum values from different Enum types is invalid.

[[Error_TS2367]]

<!-- skip -->
```typescript
enum X {
    A,
    B,
}
enum Y {
    A,
    B,
    C,
}
const xa: number = X.A; // Valid
const ya: Y = 0; // Valid
X.A === Y.A; // Invalid
```

`>Out:`

error TS2367: This comparison appears to be unintentional because the types 'X' and 'Y' have no overlap.

Instances of a class are subject to a compatibility check for their private and protected members:

<!-- skip -->
```typescript
class X {
    public a: string;
    constructor(value: string) {
        this.a = value;
    }
}

class Y {
    private a: string;
    constructor(value: string) {
        this.a = value;
    }
}

let x: X = new Y('y'); // Invalid
```

The comparison check does not take into consideration the different inheritance hierarchy, for instance:

```typescript
class X {
    public a: string;
    constructor(value: string) {
        this.a = value;
    }
}
class Y extends X {
    public a: string;
    constructor(value: string) {
        super(value);
        this.a = value;
    }
}
class Z {
    public a: string;
    constructor(value: string) {
        this.a = value;
    }
}
let x: X = new X('x');
let y: Y = new Y('y');
let z: Z = new Z('z');
x === y; // Valid
x === z; // Valid even if z is from a different inheritance hierarchy
```

Generics are compared using their structures based on the resulting type after applying the generic parameter, only the final result is compared as a non-generic type.

<!-- skip -->
```typescript
interface X<T> {
    a: T;
}
let x: X<number> = { a: 1 };
let y: X<string> = { a: 'a' };
x === y; // Invalid as the type argument is used in the final structure
```

```typescript
interface X<T> {}
const x: X<number> = 1;
const y: X<string> = 'a';
x === y; // Valid as the type argument is not used in the final structure
```

When generics do not have their type argument specified, all the unspecified arguments are treated as types with "any":

```typescript
type X = <T>(x: T) => T;
type Y = <K>(y: K) => K;
let x: X = x => x;
let y: Y = y => y;
x = y; // Valid
```

Remember:

<!-- skip -->
```typescript
let a: number = 1;
let b: number = 2;
a = b; // Valid, everything is assignable to itself

let c: any;
c = 1; // Valid, all types are assignable to any

let d: unknown;
d = 1; // Valid, all types are assignable to unknown

let e: unknown;
let e1: unknown = e; // Valid, unknown is only assignable to itself and any
let e2: any = e; // Valid
let e3: number = e; // Invalid

let f: never;
f = 1; // Invalid, nothing is assignable to never

let g: void;
let g1: any;
g = 1; // Invalid, void is not assignable to or from anything expect any
g = g1; // Valid
```

Please note that when "strictNullChecks" is enabled, "null" and "undefined" are treated similarly to "void"; otherwise, they are similar to "never".
