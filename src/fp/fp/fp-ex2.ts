/// The checkValueBetween and calculatePercentage methods in the code snippet above are highly composable. Using a helper, we can combine two of the functions and get the result we expected.
/// We were able to compose these functions because theyâ€™re both Pure functions. Our validation function, checkValueBetween, is also pure, though slightly more challenging to use. However, because it returns a monad, we can use map to pass its value to the other functions.
