TypeScript Deep Dive
=======

I've been looking at the issues that turn up commonly when people start using TypeScript. This is based on the lessons from [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/typescript/topusers) / [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/) and general engagement with the [TypeScript community](https://github.com/TypeStrong/). You can [follow for updates](https://linkedin.com/in/armanriazi) and [don't forget to â˜… on GitHub](https://github.com/armanriazi/typescript-all-in-one) ðŸŒ¹

## Get Started
If you are here to read the book online [get started](https://armanriazi.github.io/typescript/getting-started).

## Translations 
The book is completely free so you can copy and paste whatever you want without requiring permission. If you have a translation you want me to link here. [Send a PR](https://github.com/armanriazi/typescript-all-in-one/edit/main/README.md).

## Other Options
You can also download one of the Epub, Mobi, or PDF formats from the [actions tab](https://github.com/armanriazi/typescript-all-in-one/actions) by clicking on the latest build run. You will find the files in the artifacts section.
